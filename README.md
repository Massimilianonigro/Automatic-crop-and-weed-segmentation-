In this competition, ACRE organizers asked to segment RGB images to distinguish between crop, weeds, and background. As shown above.
Report of the solution adopted can be found at the [beginning of the notebook](https://github.com/Massimilianonigro/Automatic-crop-and-weed-segmentation-/blob/main/Automatic_crop_and_weed_segmentation.ipynb).
